**Why mentor?**
Interested in helping raise up your fellow developers in the node community? What better way to do it than to mentor? Watch this repo, join the conversation on [gitter](https://gitter.im/node-forward/mentors). Once you've decided you've got some heart and time to dedicate to this project, send a PR to the README.md

**Why seek out a mentor?**
Mentors are awesome encouragement when the coding gets rough. They are knowledgable and will help you steer through the murky waters of code, code committing, and community.  We're happy to chat all about this in [gitter](https://gitter.im/node-forward/mentors) too. Come say hi!
